Steps to run in your On Google Collab :
* Download the dataset from : https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition/discussion
* Save the zip file to your google drive .
* Open google collab notebook and mount the google drive to your collab notebook.
* Use `!unzip "SOURCE FOLDER WITH THE NAME OF ZIPPED FILE" -d "DESTINATION FOLDER"` to unzip file and saving it to drive .
* Then you will get a 'flowers' folder with 6 sub folders => 'daisy', 'dandelion', 'flowers', 'rose', 'sunflower', 'tulip' .
* As our dataset consist of 5 classes ,but here we may have an extra 'flowers' subfolder as a bug so we need to remove it .
* Use :
  
  `import shutil`
  
  `data_dir = 'FOLDER PATH'`
  
  `shutil.rmtree(data_dir + '/flowers')`
  
Then you are good to go :)
